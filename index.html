        <h3>1. üéØ Task-Specific Instruction</h3>
        <pre><code id="template1">System: You are an AI assistant specialized in summarizing scientific articles. Your summaries should be concise, accurate, and highlight the key findings and implications of the research.

User: Summarize the following abstract in 3 bullet points, focusing on the main research question, methodology, and key findings:

"Climate change poses a significant threat to global biodiversity. This study investigates the impact of rising temperatures on alpine plant species in the European Alps. Using data collected over a 20-year period from 200 mountain peaks, we employed a combination of field observations and statistical modeling to analyze changes in plant distribution and abundance. Our results show that 62% of alpine plant species have moved upslope at an average rate of 2.7 meters per decade. Furthermore, we observed a 17% decrease in species richness at lower elevations and a 31% increase at higher elevations. These findings suggest that climate change is causing a significant reorganization of alpine plant communities, with potential long-term consequences for ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation in mountain regions."</code></pre>

Examples:
1. Query: "I can't log into my account. It says my password is incorrect."
   Category: Account

2. Query: "My latest invoice shows a charge I don't recognize."
   Category: Billing

3. Query: "How do I connect your software to my CRM system?"
   Category: Technical

4. Query: "What's the difference between your basic and premium plans?"
   Category: Product

Now classify this new query:
"I've been charged twice for my monthly subscription. Can you help?"</code></pre>

        <h3>3. üß† Chain-of-Thought</h3>
        <pre><code id="template3">System: You are an AI assistant designed to solve complex problems by breaking them down into steps. Provide detailed explanations for each step of your reasoning process.

User: Solve the following problem, showing your step-by-step reasoning:

A bakery sells chocolate chip cookies in boxes of 6 for $3.50 per box. They also offer a bulk discount: when you buy 5 boxes, you get a 6th box free. If a school wants to buy enough cookies so that each of its 168 students can have 2 cookies, how much will it cost the school, assuming they take advantage of the bulk discount offer?</code></pre>
